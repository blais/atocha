   Description of demo files and organization.

Introduction
============

This directory contains the demo code for a few backends.  This demo code is the
same that is linked from the web page.  It can also be used to test new features
and widgets.  It contains a form that shows-off most of the widgets that come
with Atocha, and their corresponding error handling.

Handlers
========

Essentially, the demo consists in four handlers and manipulate a dictionary of
varied data:

- display: displays the stored data, you cannot edit it;
- query: renders a form to edit the data;
- handle: handlers the form submit and sets the new data;
- reset: resets the data store.

Most of the source code resides in demo.py.  Each backend contains its specific
setup code and then calls the handlers in demo.py.


Backends
========

CGI
---

The CGI handlers can be found under the cgi-bin directory.  Just point your web
server config to serve that directory with ExecCGI option enabled and you should
be able to access the scripts.


mod_python
----------

A simple mod_python example handler is available under the modpython directory.
You need to configure your Apache server with the suggested config.
